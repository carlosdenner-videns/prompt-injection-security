## Dataset

### Composition (120 Novel Attacks)

| Attack Type | Count | Description |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| Alternative Phrasing | 20 | "Disregard your instructions...", "Forget everything..." |
| Instruction Embedding | 20 | JSON, YAML, XML, code blocks with embedded instructions |
| Multi-Turn Manipulation | 20 | "In our previous conversation...", "You agreed earlier..." |
| Context Confusion | 20 | Roleplay, hypothetical scenarios, simulations |
| Encoding/Obfuscation | 20 | Base64, ROT13, Hex, Unicode escapes, Leetspeak |
| Indirect Instruction | 20 | "What would you do if...", "Describe how to bypass..." |

**Key Difference from Phase 1**: Phase 1 attacks used specific evasion techniques (plain, delimiter, role confusion, etc.). Phase 6b attacks use novel phrasing and techniques not in Phase 1.

### Overall TPR Comparison

| Configuration | TPR | TP | FN | Status |
|---------------|-----|----|----|--------|
| v1 | 11.7% | 14 | 106 | ❌ Very low |
| v3 | 44.2% | 53 | 67 | ⚠️ Moderate |
| v1+v3 | 49.2% | 59 | 61 | ⚠️ Moderate |
| Normalizer+v1 | 11.7% | 14 | 106 | ❌ Very low |
| Normalizer+v3 | 44.2% | 53 | 67 | ⚠️ Moderate |
| **Normalizer+v1+v3** | **49.2%** | **59** | **61** | **⚠️ Best** |

### TPR by Attack Type

#### Alternative Phrasing (20 samples)
- v1: 5% TPR (1/20) ❌
- v3: 40% TPR (8/20) ⚠️
- v1+v3: 40% TPR (8/20) ⚠️
- Normalizer+v1+v3: 40% TPR (8/20) ⚠️

**Issue**: Signature matching (v1) fails on paraphrased instructions. v3 catches some but misses 60%.

#### Instruction Embedding (20 samples)
- v1: 20% TPR (4/20) ❌
- v3: 85% TPR (17/20) ✅
- v1+v3: 95% TPR (19/20) ✅
- Normalizer+v1+v3: 95% TPR (19/20) ✅

**Strength**: Structured formats (JSON, YAML, XML) are well-detected by v3.

#### Multi-Turn Manipulation (20 samples)
- v1: 0% TPR (0/20) ❌❌
- v3: 40% TPR (8/20) ⚠️
- v1+v3: 40% TPR (8/20) ⚠️
- Normalizer+v1+v3: 40% TPR (8/20) ⚠️

**Critical Gap**: Multi-turn manipulation is poorly detected. Detectors don't understand conversation context.

#### Context Confusion (20 samples)
- v1: 10% TPR (2/20) ❌
- v3: 15% TPR (3/20) ❌
- v1+v3: 25% TPR (5/20) ❌
- Normalizer+v1+v3: 25% TPR (5/20) ❌

**Critical Gap**: Roleplay and hypothetical scenarios evade detection (75% miss rate).

#### Encoding/Obfuscation (20 samples)
- v1: 25% TPR (5/20) ❌
- v3: 35% TPR (7/20) ⚠️
- v1+v3: 45% TPR (9/20) ⚠️
- Normalizer+v1+v3: 45% TPR (9/20) ⚠️

**Issue**: Encoded attacks (Base64, ROT13, Hex) are harder to detect. Normalizer doesn't decode.

#### Indirect Instruction (20 samples)
- v1: 10% TPR (2/20) ❌
- v3: 50% TPR (10/20) ⚠️
- v1+v3: 50% TPR (10/20) ⚠️
- Normalizer+v1+v3: 50% TPR (10/20) ⚠️

**Moderate**: v3 catches some probing attacks but misses 50%.

## Key Insights

### 1. Normalizer Doesn't Help on Novel Attacks

**Observation**: Normalizer+v1+v3 TPR = v1+v3 TPR (49.2%)
- Normalizer is designed for obfuscation (homoglyphs, ZWJ, etc.)
- Novel attacks don't use obfuscation
- Therefore, normalizer provides no benefit

**Implication**: Normalizer is effective for obfuscation-benign (Phase 6a) but not for novel attacks (Phase 6b).

### 2. v1 (Signature) is Brittle on Novel Attacks

**v1 TPR**: 11.7% (14/120)
- Fails on alternative phrasing (5%)
- Fails on multi-turn (0%)
- Fails on context confusion (10%)
- Only works on instruction embedding (20%)

**Insight**: Signature matching requires exact keyword matches. Paraphrasing breaks it.

### 3. v3 (Semantic) is More Robust

**v3 TPR**: 44.2% (53/120)
- Better on alternative phrasing (40% vs 5%)
- Better on multi-turn (40% vs 0%)
- Better on encoding (35% vs 25%)
- Excellent on instruction embedding (85%)

**Insight**: Semantic approach catches more novel attacks than signature matching.

### 4. Critical Coverage Gaps

**Multi-Turn Manipulation**: 0-40% TPR
- Detectors don't understand conversation context
- "You agreed earlier..." attacks evade detection
- Requires conversation history tracking

**Context Confusion**: 15-25% TPR
- Roleplay and hypothetical scenarios evade detection
- "Pretend you're..." attacks mostly succeed
- Requires understanding of hypothetical framing

**Encoding/Obfuscation**: 35-45% TPR
- Base64, ROT13, Hex-encoded attacks partially evade
- Normalizer doesn't decode
- Would need decoding layer

### 5. Ensemble Helps on Novel Attacks

**v1 alone**: 11.7% TPR
**v3 alone**: 44.2% TPR
**v1+v3**: 49.2% TPR
- **Lift**: +5% from ensemble
- Smaller than Phase 1 (87% vs 80% for v1 alone)
- Suggests v3 dominates on novel attacks

---

## Comparison to Phase 5 Goal

### Phase 5 Goal
- TPR ≥ 50% on novel attacks

### Phase 6b Results
- **Normalizer+v1+v3**: 49.2% TPR ❌ **GOAL NOT MET** (0.8% short)
- **v1+v3**: 49.2% TPR ❌ **GOAL NOT MET** (0.8% short)

**Conclusion**: System achieves 49.2% TPR on novel attacks, just missing the 50% goal.

## Recommendations

### For Production

**Use Normalizer+v1+v3** (best available):
- TPR: 49.2% on novel attacks
- FAR: 12.3% on obfuscated benign (from Phase 6a)
- Trade-off: Catches ~50% of novel attacks, but misses ~50%

**Accept the Gap**:
- Novel attacks are harder to detect than Phase 1 attacks
- 49.2% TPR is reasonable for unseen attack types
- Recommend monitoring for novel attack patterns

### For Future Improvement

**Address Critical Gaps**:

1. **Multi-Turn Manipulation** (0% TPR):
   - Implement conversation history tracking
   - Detect inconsistencies in system behavior
   - Effort: High (requires architectural changes)

2. **Context Confusion** (25% TPR):
   - Detect roleplay/hypothetical framing
   - Implement context-aware detection
   - Effort: High (requires NLU)

3. **Encoding/Obfuscation** (45% TPR):
   - Add decoding layer (Base64, ROT13, Hex)
   - Detect entropy anomalies
   - Effort: Medium

4. **Alternative Phrasing** (40% TPR):
   - Expand keyword dictionary
   - Use semantic similarity matching
   - Effort: Medium

## Limitations

1. **Synthetic attacks**: Generated patterns, not real attacker techniques
2. **Limited diversity**: 120 samples (could expand to 500+)
3. **No adaptive attacks**: Doesn't test attacks designed to evade this system
4. **No LLM evaluation**: Doesn't test actual attack success on LLMs

---

## Conclusion

Phase 6b reveals that while the system is effective on Phase 1 attacks (87% TPR), it achieves only 49.2% TPR on novel/adaptive attacks not seen in training.

**Key Achievement**: 
- ✅ Identified critical coverage gaps (multi-turn, context confusion)
- ✅ Demonstrated that v3 is more robust than v1 on novel attacks
- ✅ Confirmed normalizer is effective for obfuscation but not novel attacks
- ⚠️ **Coverage gap**: 51% of novel attacks still evade detection

**Recommendation**: 
- Deploy Normalizer+v1+v3 for production
- Monitor for novel attack patterns
- Plan future improvements for multi-turn and context confusion
