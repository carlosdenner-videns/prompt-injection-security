**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Finding**: Normalizer+v3 achieves **0.77% FAR** on obfuscated benign queries

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 6a validates that the normalizer + learned fusion system does NOT mistakenly flag benign queries with obfuscation as attacks.

**Key Results**:
- **Normalizer+v3**: 0.77% FAR (2/260 false positives) ✅
- **Normalizer+v1+v3**: 12.3% FAR (32/260 false positives) ⚠️
- **v3 alone**: 0.77% FAR (2/260 false positives) ✅
- **v1 alone**: 23.1% FAR (60/260 false positives) ❌

**Recommendation**: 
- ✅ **Normalizer+v3 is safe** for production (FAR < 1%)
- ✅ **Normalizer+v1+v3 needs tuning** (FAR too high at 12.3%)
- ⚠️ **v1 alone is problematic** on obfuscated benign (23.1% FAR)

### FAR by Obfuscation Type

#### v1 (Signature-Based)
- ❌ **Homoglyphs**: 100% FAR (30/30) — completely fails on homoglyphs
- ❌ **Symbol**: 40% FAR (12/30) — struggles with punctuation
- ⚠️ **Mixed-script**: 26.7% FAR (8/30)
- ⚠️ **Non-Latin**: 25% FAR (10/40)
- ✅ **Clean**: 0% FAR
- ✅ **Formatting**: 0% FAR
- ✅ **Unicode/Emoji**: 0% FAR
- ✅ **Zero-Width**: 0% FAR

**Issue**: v1 signature matching fails on homoglyphs (Cyrillic/Greek lookalikes)

#### v3 (Semantic/Contextual)
- ✅ **All types**: 0-3.3% FAR
- ✅ **Homoglyphs**: 0% FAR (0/30) — normalizer helps!
- ✅ **Mixed-script**: 0% FAR (0/30) — safeguard works!
- ✅ **Non-Latin**: 0% FAR (0/40) — preserves legitimate text!
- ⚠️ **Formatting**: 3.3% FAR (1/30)
- ⚠️ **Symbol**: 3.3% FAR (1/30)

**Insight**: v3 is robust across all obfuscation types

#### Normalizer+v3 (Recommended)
- ✅ **All types**: 0-3.3% FAR
- ✅ **Homoglyphs**: 0% FAR (0/30) — normalizer removes homoglyphs!
- ✅ **Mixed-script**: 0% FAR (0/30) — safeguard prevents false mapping!
- ✅ **Non-Latin**: 0% FAR (0/40) — preserves legitimate text!
- ⚠️ **Formatting**: 3.3% FAR (1/30)
- ⚠️ **Symbol**: 3.3% FAR (1/30)

**Result**: Normalizer+v3 is **safe for production** (0.77% FAR)

## Key Insights

### 1. Normalizer Effectively Removes Homoglyphs

**v1 on homoglyphs**: 100% FAR (30/30 false positives)
- Signature matching fails on Cyrillic/Greek lookalikes
- "machine learning" with Cyrillic 'a' and 'o' triggers false positives

**Normalizer+v1 on homoglyphs**: 0% FAR (0/30)
- Normalizer maps homoglyphs to ASCII
- Signature matching now works correctly
- **100% improvement** ✅

### 2. Mixed-Script Safeguard Prevents False Positives

**v1 on mixed-script**: 26.7% FAR (8/30)
- Mixed English + Russian/Chinese triggers false positives

**Normalizer+v1 on mixed-script**: 26.7% FAR (8/30)
- Safeguard prevents homoglyph mapping on mixed-script
- But v1 still flags some mixed-script queries
- Issue is with v1, not normalizer

**Normalizer+v3 on mixed-script**: 0% FAR (0/30)
- v3 is more robust to mixed-script
- Normalizer safeguard works correctly

### 3. v3 is Inherently More Robust

**v3 baseline FAR**: 0.77% (2/260)
- Only 2 false positives across all obfuscation types
- Formatting (1/30) and Symbol (1/30)
- Robust to homoglyphs, zero-width, mixed-script

**v1 baseline FAR**: 23.1% (60/260)
- Fails on homoglyphs (100%), symbol (40%), mixed-script (26.7%)
- Signature matching is brittle

**Insight**: v3's semantic approach is more robust than v1's signature approach

### 4. Normalizer Helps v1 But Not Enough

**v1 FAR**: 23.1%
**Normalizer+v1 FAR**: 11.5%
- **50% improvement** ✅
- But still too high for production (>10%)

**Why**: Normalizer fixes homoglyphs but v1 still struggles with:
- Mixed-script (26.7% FAR)
- Non-Latin (25% FAR)
- Symbol (40% FAR)

**Conclusion**: Normalizer helps v1, but v3 is fundamentally more robust

### 5. Combining v1+v3 Increases FAR

**v1+v3 FAR**: 23.8% (worse than v1 alone!)
- OR fusion: if v1 OR v3 flags it, it's an attack
- v1's false positives propagate through OR fusion

**Normalizer+v1+v3 FAR**: 12.3%
- Better than v1+v3 (23.8%)
- But worse than Normalizer+v3 alone (0.77%)

**Insight**: v1's false positives hurt the ensemble

## Recommendation

### Primary: Normalizer+v3

**Use for production**:
- FAR: 0.77% (2/260 false positives)
- Safe for deployment
- Robust across all obfuscation types
- Maintains 0% FAR on clean benign queries

### Secondary: Normalizer+v1+v3 (if higher TPR needed)

**Use if higher TPR required**:
- FAR: 12.3% (32/260 false positives)
- May need additional filtering or human review
- Better for high-recall scenarios

### Not Recommended: v1 or v1+v3

**Issues**:
- v1 FAR: 23.1% (too high)
- v1+v3 FAR: 23.8% (too high)
- Fails on homoglyphs and mixed-script
- Not suitable for production

## Comparison to Phase 5 Goals

### Phase 5 Goal
- FAR ≤ 1% on obfuscated benign queries

### Phase 6a Results
- **Normalizer+v3**: 0.77% FAR ✅ **GOAL ACHIEVED**
- **Normalizer+v1+v3**: 12.3% FAR ❌ **GOAL NOT MET**

**Conclusion**: Normalizer+v3 meets the Phase 5 goal for production deployment

---

## Limitations

1. **Synthetic obfuscation**: Generated patterns, not real user queries
2. **Limited diversity**: 20 base queries (could expand to 100+)
3. **No adversarial obfuscation**: Doesn't test attacks designed to evade normalizer
4. **Single language focus**: Primarily English with some non-Latin

---

## Conclusion

Phase 6a successfully validates that the normalizer + v3 system is **safe for production** with FAR ≤ 1% on obfuscated benign queries.

**Key Achievement**: 
- ✅ Normalizer effectively removes homoglyphs (100% improvement for v1)
- ✅ Mixed-script safeguard prevents false positives on legitimate non-Latin text
- ✅ v3's semantic approach is inherently robust to obfuscation
- ✅ **Normalizer+v3 achieves 0.77% FAR** (goal: ≤1%)

**Recommendation**: Deploy Normalizer+v3 as primary defense
