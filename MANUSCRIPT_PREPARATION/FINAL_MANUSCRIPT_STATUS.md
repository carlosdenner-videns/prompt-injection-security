## 💡 Cover Letter Talking Points

When submitting to CACM, emphasize:

### **1. Practical Value**
> "This article provides immediately deployable guidance for practitioners building LLM-based systems. The 'LLM firewall' concept offers a concrete, actionable solution to OWASP's #1 LLM security risk."

### **2. Real-World Grounding**
> "We ground the work in 4 recent real-world attack cases (2024-2025) and 18 industry patent filings, demonstrating both urgency and industry convergence on input-side filtering."

### **3. Accessible Presentation**
> "The article is written for CACM's broad audience. Technical concepts are explained with analogies (antivirus, web security), and all references are self-contained. Non-ML engineers can understand and apply the guidance."

### **4. Story-Driven Narrative**
> "Rather than enumerating experiments, we frame the work as answering key practitioner questions: How vulnerable are LLMs? What detectors work? Is this fast enough for production? Each phase includes surprising findings and practical implications."

### **5. Honest Limitations**
> "We're transparent about limitations (49% detection on novel attacks) and provide mitigation paths. This honesty, combined with concrete metrics (87% on known attacks, <1ms latency), helps practitioners set realistic expectations."

### **6. Reproducibility**
> "All code, data, and evaluation scripts are available on GitHub. The article includes detailed experimental setup, enabling replication and building upon our work."
