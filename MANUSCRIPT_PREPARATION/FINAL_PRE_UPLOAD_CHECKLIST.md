## ✅ Should-Improve (Completed)

### **4. Simplified Compound Sentences** ✅

**Location:** Discussion section, p.18

**Before (compound sentence):**
> "The answer is defense in depth: while RLHF-trained models attempt to refuse malicious instructions, they are far from foolproof---as evidenced by the proliferation of jailbreak techniques and our own baseline measurements showing 65% attack success on LLaMA-2 (Figure~\ref{fig:baseline})."

**After (simplified):**
> "The answer is defense in depth. RLHF-trained models attempt to refuse malicious instructions, but they are far from foolproof. The proliferation of jailbreak techniques and our own baseline measurements (65% attack success on LLaMA-2, Figure~\ref{fig:baseline}) demonstrate this vulnerability."

**Impact:** ✅ Improved readability with shorter, clearer sentences

---

## ✅ Nice-to-Have (Completed)

### **5. Practitioner Takeaway Tagline** ✅

**Added after abstract:**
> **Practitioner takeaway:** A simple, sub-millisecond input filter can neutralize most prompt-injection vectors in today's LLM pipelines.

**Impact:** ✅ Provides immediate, actionable summary for practitioners

---

### **6. Stylistic Polish** ✅

**Checked:**
- ✅ Em-dash spacing (consistent throughout)
- ✅ En-dash usage (proper)
- ✅ Figure numbers sequential (verified)

**Status:** ✅ All stylistic elements consistent

## 📞 Final Notes

### **For CACM Editors:**

**Sidebar Recommendation:**
The "Best practices checklist" in §5 (p.17–18) is formatted with bold headers and imperative mood, ready for conversion to a shaded call-out box during production.

**Concrete Example:**
A footnote in §4.2 provides a visceral before/after example showing how the Normalizer and detectors work together to block an obfuscated attack.

**Ethics:**
Data Availability section includes responsible disclosure practices, noting that exfiltration endpoints and sensitive information will be redacted from shared attack corpus.

**Practitioner Takeaway:**
Added immediately after abstract to provide quick, actionable summary for busy practitioners.
